# Project Info
Harker Spirit was a spirit points dashboard I wrote for my high school during virtual school (2020-2021). Essentially, it's a place for people to view spirit rankings, spirit event info, and links to photos/ videos/ forms that the spirit leadership may want to broadcast. Users must log into their Harker accounts to view the page.
